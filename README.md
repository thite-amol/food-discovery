## Background

As a self-proclaimed "foodie" in Pune, I wanted to find out more than just how the food tastes, but the experience that my fellow residents (or tourists!) had within my own beloved city. I wanted to prove or disprove current ideas, such as how the best food comes from downtown, as well as find out new facts about the city I have been living in for the last 7 years.




* On average, where are the highest rated restaurants located? 

* Are we an expensive city to eat in? 

* Which genre of cuisine is the most common to find? 


In this exploratory data analysis, I will found out answers to these questions and more with my trusty friend; data.
